# Machine-Learning-Models
# Summary

### Goal:

- Neural Networks

### Testing Metrics:
- Accuracy, recall, precision
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrices
- ROC curve

### Description: 
Utilize three unique datasets to test and evaulation different machine learning models and preprocessing techniques to compare how they perform. The models used are K-means, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks.
The performance of the models was determined through accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score, and graphs like correlation heat maps and confusion matrices. This project let me explore a large variety of machine learning models and preprocessing techniques that can be used as well as how to test them. An example from the testing is shown below where one model is overfitting after a couple of epochs because the validation accuracy is decreasing while the training accuracy is increasing.
