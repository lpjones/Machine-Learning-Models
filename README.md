# Machine-Learning-Models
The Machine_Learning_models.ipynb notebook goes through different datasets and uses different machine learning models and preprocessing techniques such as PCA, K-means, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks. Each model is tested using metrics of accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score, as well as looking at graphs like correlation heat maps and confusion matrices to determine whether the models performed well.
